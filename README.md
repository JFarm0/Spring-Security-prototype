# Spring-Security-prototype

During the ideation phase of our LiftOff capstone project, I created a proof-of-concept build with Spring Boot, Security, JPA, Gradle, Thymeleaf with Bootstrap to be added. A team-member was working in parallel with me making a similar build. She got her prototype built up more robustly, so we ended up using her build as the foundation of the project.
